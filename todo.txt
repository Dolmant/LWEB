Now:

Later - easy:
load common scripts (react, etc) from CDN?
assets/thumbs/SVSM needs regenerating - I have 4MB files in there
regenerate all images into jpegs with reasonable compression and add an even smaller placeholder + blurring for the thumbs stuff

Later - hard:
add videos to list of stuff so they display and play
Add image URL fingerprints?
when you click on something in the about me section, brings up the contact me page pre filled
put page transitions in for flicking between menus
