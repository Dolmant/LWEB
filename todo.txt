Now:
animation still jumps when scrolling from the animation

Later - easy:
load common scripts (react, etc) from CDN?
fix address and everything (font as well)
get background for contact page from Leonie
assets/thumbs/SVSM needs regenerating - I have 4MB files in there
regenerate all images into jpegs with reasonable compression and add an even smaller placeholder + blurring for the thumbs stuff

Later - hard:
add videos to list of stuff so they display and play
Add image URL fingerprints?
when you click on something in the about me section, brings up the contact me page pre filled
put page transitions in for flicking between menus
mobile optimisation
